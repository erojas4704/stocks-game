buy_stock

Explain why they're there.

If you have more than 1 condition in your if, consider creating another function

modal.js terrible. you can make a lot of functions or descriptive variable strings

stock.js

Falsy counts as 0?

=======Egregious======
CSS - Too many importants. If you're more specific in CSS it takes priority.
Important is bad. last resort. If oyu have any bug, it will be really hard to fix.

Comments should be specific even if you comment out functinality

Commit messages need to explain what I'm doing. You could've committed why you commented out in CSS.
